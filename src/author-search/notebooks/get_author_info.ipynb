I test my model against\\nprevious one dimensional analyses of the BAO signal in the WiggleZ data and\\nagainst WizCOLA simulations, and find it to be free of bias or systematic\\noffsets. However, the analysis on the wedge data format was unable to properly\\nconstrain cosmological parameters, and thus discarded in favour of the\\nmultipole analysis. The multipole analysis determined $\\\\Omega_c h^2$, $H(z)$\\nand $D_A(z)$ for three redshift bins, of effective redshifts $z = 0.44, 0.60$\\nand $0.73$.

The Forward-Forward algorithm replaces the\\nforward and backward passes of backpropagation by two forward passes, one with\\npositive (i.e. real) data and the other with negative data which could be\\ngenerated by the network itself. Each layer has its own objective function\\nwhich is simply to have high goodness for positive data and low goodness for\\nnegative data. The sum of the squared activities in a layer can be used as the\\ngoodness but there are many other possibilities, including minus the sum of the\\nsquared activities. If the positive and negative passes could be separated in\\ntime, the negative passes could be done offline, which would make the learning\\nmuch simpler in the positive pass and allow video to be pipelined through the\\nnetwork without ever storing activities or stopping to propagate derivatives.'},\n",

The inversion method consists of (i)\\ndetermining the flux and basal stress from the free-surface evolution, (ii)\\ncomparing the flux to the basal stress to constrain $F$ and (iii) inferring the\\nconstitutive law from $F$. Examples are presented for both steady and transient\\nfree-surface flows demonstrating that a wide range of constitutive laws can be\\ndirectly obtained.
